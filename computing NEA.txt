   - 3 types of doggo, with different stats:- big: burnese mountain dog, medium: siberian husky, smol: Papillon, after game extra: whippet. 
   - stats are: movement, swimming abiltiy, obidience
   - each of the dogs gets distracted by other things in the level, the player's aim is to avoid these things. the more the player does what the owner says to, the less they get distracted by every scent around.
